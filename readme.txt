This is a very simple calculating app, made for my own use - 
it accepts 3 inputs and then it calculates the cross-calculation.
I wrote this little app because I often find myself struggling with
doing calculations of this kind in my head, so I figured it would
be nice to have a little app to asist myself.

Made with vanilla js, HTML and CSS.
